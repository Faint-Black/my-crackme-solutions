# My Crack-Mes Solutions
A collection of my solved crackmes binaries challenges.

Each challenge directory is named in a chronological order from when i solved it. "dump.txt" is the read-only ELF dump text file of the crackme binary, "notes/" contains the manual machine code analysis, "recreated-src/" contains an ANSI C source file that possibly represents what the original source of the binary may have looked like, it also may contain a separate keygen function that automatically generates a solution to the CTF. The crackme binaries are *not* included directly inside the repository and must be downloaded separately from their original domains.
